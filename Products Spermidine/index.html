                <p>Autophagy is pronounced "ah-TAH-fah-gee".
                    Autophagy is a biological mechanism by which cells maintain homeostasis and secure their survival
                    under a variety of situations. The term "autophagy" is derived from the Greek words for "self" and
                    "eating," which provides insight into its fundamental function.</p>
                <p> Autophagy is a vital, natural mechanism that keeps our bodies in good health. Consider it your
                    body's housekeeping service, effectively removing damaged cells and recycling them as vital building
                    blocks. This process is critical for delaying the aging process and protecting against disease. </p>

                <p> Spermidine, a naturally occurring chemical, acts as a catalyst in this housekeeping activity.
                    Scientifically, it inhibits an enzyme called acetyltransferase EP300, which activates autophagy.
                    This suggests that spermidine helps provide the</p>
